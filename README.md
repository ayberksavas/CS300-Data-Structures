# CS300 – Data Structures

This repository contains my solutions and projects developed as part of the **CS300 – Data Structures** course at **Sabancı University**.

## Language and Tools

- **Programming language:** C++  
- **Development environment:** Compatible with standard C++ compilers  
- **Focus:** Implementation and application of core data structures and algorithms

## Projects and Assignments

The assignments in this course focus on solving algorithmic problems using fundamental data structures. Notable projects include:

- **Homework 1:** Implemented an AI-powered 3x3 **Tic Tac Toe** game using:
  - An **N-ary tree** structure to represent the game state space
  - The **Minimax algorithm** to determine optimal moves for the AI player

- **Homework 2:** Worked on data compression and hashing, including:
  - **Ziv-Lempel Algorithm** in compression 
  - Implementation and usage of **hashing** and **hash tables** for efficient data management
